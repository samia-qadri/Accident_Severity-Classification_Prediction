PROJECT : Road Traffic Severity Classification Prediction 

Name: Samia Qadri

Hello! Myself Samia Qadri, student of BSSE, UBIT ,University of karachi. 
This project is done as part of my side course of AI AND Data Science.
This project predicts the severity level of road traffic accidents using machine learning models. I have done it by implementing some different Machine Learning models as:
> Random Forest Classifier
> XGBoost Classifier
> Logistic Regression
> SVM (RBF Kernel)
> KNN (k=7)

Data set has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident.
The target feature is Accident_severity which is a multi-class variable and metric for evaluation is f1-score.

Feedbacks and suggestions are welcome! Email: qadrisamia09@gmail.com
